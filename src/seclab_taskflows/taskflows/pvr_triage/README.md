# PVR Triage Taskflows

Tools for triaging GitHub Security Advisories submitted via [Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). The taskflows fetch an advisory in triage state, verify the claimed vulnerability against actual source code, detect duplicate reports, score report quality, and generate a structured analysis and a ready-to-send response draft.

Four taskflows cover the full triage lifecycle:

| Taskflow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pvr_triage` | Deep-analyse one advisory end-to-end |
| `pvr_triage_batch` | Score an entire inbox and produce a ranked queue |
| `pvr_respond` | Post the response for one advisory once you've reviewed the analysis |
| `pvr_respond_batch` | Scan REPORT_DIR and post all pending response drafts in a single session |

---

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.9 (or Docker via `run_seclab_agent.sh`)
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- A GitHub token with **`repo`** and **`security_events`** scopes
  - Write-back actions (`pvr_respond`) additionally require **`security_events` write** scope
- AI API credentials (`AI_API_TOKEN`, `AI_API_ENDPOINT`)

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required by | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GH_TOKEN` | all | GitHub personal access token |
| `AI_API_TOKEN` | all | API key for the AI provider |
| `AI_API_ENDPOINT` | all | Model endpoint (defaults to `https://api.githubcopilot.com`) |
| `REPORT_DIR` | all | Directory where triage reports are written. Defaults to `./reports` |
| `LOG_DIR` | all | Directory for MCP server logs. Auto-detected via `platformdirs` if not set |
| `REPORTER_DB_DIR` | `pvr_triage` | Directory for the reporter reputation SQLite database. Auto-detected if not set |
| `PVR_CONTAINER_VALIDATION` | `pvr_triage` | Set to `true` to enable container-based SAST and reachability validation. Requires Docker. |
| `CONTAINER_WORKSPACE` | `pvr_triage` | Host directory mounted to `/workspace` in the SAST container. Optional. |

A minimal `.env` for local use:

```
GH_TOKEN=ghp_...
AI_API_TOKEN=...
AI_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.githubcopilot.com
REPORT_DIR=/path/to/reports
LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs
```

## Taskflow 1 — Single advisory triage (`pvr_triage`)

Runs a full analysis on one GHSA in triage state and produces:

- A structured triage report saved to `REPORT_DIR/<GHSA-ID>_triage.md`
- A response draft saved to `REPORT_DIR/<GHSA-ID>_response_triage.md`
- A record in the reporter reputation database

```bash
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_triage \
  -g repo=owner/repo \
  -g ghsa=GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

### What it does (9 tasks)

1. **Initialize** — clears the in-memory cache.
2. **Fetch & parse** — fetches the advisory from the GitHub API and extracts structured metadata: vulnerability type, affected component, file references, PoC quality signals, reporter credits.
3. **Quality gate** — calls `get_reporter_score` for the reporter's history, `find_similar_triage_reports` to find prior reports, and `compare_advisories` to detect duplicates in the current triage inbox. Computes `fast_close` using a reputation-gated decision tree:
   - **high-trust reporter** → always `fast_close = false` (full verification).
   - **skepticism reporter** → `fast_close = true` when all three quality signals are absent (prior similar report not required).
   - **normal / no history** → `fast_close = true` only when all three signals are absent *and* a prior similar report exists.
   Fast-close skips deep code analysis. Duplicate detection results are surfaced in the report but never trigger automatic fast-close.
4. **Code verification** — resolves the claimed version to a git tag/SHA, fetches the relevant source files, and checks whether the vulnerability pattern is actually present. After verifying at the claimed version, also checks HEAD to determine patch status (`still_vulnerable` / `patched` / `could_not_determine`). Skipped automatically when `fast_close` is true.
5. **Container validation** (optional) — when `PVR_CONTAINER_VALIDATION=true`, clones the repo at the affected version into an isolated SAST container and performs: semgrep scanning on reported files, call graph / reachability analysis on reported functions (pyan3 for Python, cscope for C/C++), best-effort PoC reproduction, and patch diff analysis. Skipped when not enabled or when fast-close is active.
6. **Report generation** — writes a markdown report covering: Verdict, Code Verification, Validation Results (if container validation ran), Severity Assessment, CVSS 3.1 assessment, Duplicate/Prior Reports, Patch Status, Report Quality, Reporter Reputation, and Recommendations.
7. **Save report** — writes the report to `REPORT_DIR/<GHSA-ID>_triage.md` and prints the path.
8. **Response draft** — drafts a plain-text reply to the reporter (≤200 words, no markdown headers) tailored to the verdict: acknowledge + credit for CONFIRMED, cite evidence for UNCONFIRMED, explain missing info for INCONCLUSIVE, or request specific details for fast-close.
9. **Update reputation + save response** — records the triage outcome in the reporter reputation database and saves the response draft to `REPORT_DIR/<GHSA-ID>_response_triage.md`.

## Taskflow 2 — Batch inbox scoring (`pvr_triage_batch`)

Lists advisories in triage state for a repository, scores each unprocessed one by priority, and saves a ranked markdown table. Advisories with an existing triage report in `REPORT_DIR` are skipped and their count is noted in the output.

```bash
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_triage_batch \
  -g repo=owner/repo
```

### Output

Saved to `REPORT_DIR/batch_queue_<repo>_<date>.md`:

```markdown
# PVR Batch Triage Queue: owner/repo

| GHSA | Age (days) | Severity | Vuln Type | Quality Signals | Priority | Duplicates | Status | Suggested Action |
|------|------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| GHSA-... | 14 | high | SQL injection | PoC, Files | 6 | - | Not triaged | Triage Immediately |
| GHSA-... | 7 | high | SQL injection | PoC | 4 | GHSA-... [strong] | Not triaged | Likely Duplicate -- Triage Best |
| GHSA-... | 3 | medium | XSS | None | 1 | - | Not triaged | Likely Low Quality -- Fast Close |
```

Rows are sorted by priority score descending; ties are broken by `created_at` ascending (oldest advisory first).

### Priority scoring

Advisories with an existing report in `REPORT_DIR` are skipped entirely. Only unprocessed advisories are scored:

```
priority_score = severity_weight + quality_weight

severity_weight:  critical=4  high=3  medium=2  low=1  unknown=1
quality_weight:   has_file_references(+1) + has_poc(+1) + has_line_numbers(+1)
```

**Suggested actions:**

| Score | Action |
|---|---|
| ≥ 5 | Triage Immediately |
| ≥ 3 | Triage Soon |
| 2 | Triage |
| ≤ 1 | Likely Low Quality — Fast Close |

---

## Taskflow 3 — Write-back (`pvr_respond`)

Loads an existing triage report and applies the chosen state transition to the GitHub advisory. All write-back calls are confirm-gated — the agent will prompt for confirmation before making any change.

```bash
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_respond \
  -g repo=owner/repo \
  -g ghsa=GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx \
  -g action=accept
```

### Actions

| `action` | API call | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `accept` | Sets advisory state to `draft` (triage → draft) | Vulnerability confirmed — maintainer intends to publish an advisory |
| `reject` | Sets advisory state to `closed` | Report is clearly invalid or low quality |

> **Note:** `pvr_respond` requires that `pvr_triage` has already been run for the GHSA so that `<GHSA-ID>_triage.md` and `<GHSA-ID>_response_triage.md` exist in `REPORT_DIR`.

> **Posting the response:** The GitHub REST API has no comments endpoint for security advisories. After running `pvr_respond`, post the response draft manually via the advisory URL. See [`MANUAL_RESPONSE.md`](MANUAL_RESPONSE.md) for instructions and language.

### Confirm gate

The toolbox marks `accept_pvr_advisory` and `reject_pvr_advisory` as `confirm`-gated. The agent will print the verdict and summary, then ask for explicit confirmation before making any change to GitHub.

After a successful state transition, `pvr_respond` calls `mark_response_sent` to create a `<GHSA-ID>_response_sent.md` marker so `pvr_respond_batch` will skip this advisory in future runs.

---

## Taskflow 4 — Bulk respond (`pvr_respond_batch`)

Scans `REPORT_DIR` for advisories that have a response draft (`*_response_triage.md`) but no applied marker (`*_response_sent.md`), and applies the chosen state transition to each in a single session.

```bash
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_respond_batch \
  -g repo=owner/repo \
  -g action=reject

# or via the helper script:
./scripts/run_pvr_triage.sh respond_batch owner/repo reject
```

### How it works

**Task 1** calls `list_pending_responses` (local read-only, no confirm gate) to find all pending advisories and prints a summary table. If there are none it stops immediately.

**Task 2** iterates over every pending entry:
1. Reads the triage report from disk.
2. Prints a per-item summary (GHSA, verdict).
3. Executes the chosen action (`accept` / `reject`) via the confirm-gated write-back tool.
4. On success, calls `mark_response_sent` to create a `*_response_sent.md` marker so the advisory is skipped in future runs.

Prints a final count and a reminder to post each response draft manually.

### Applied markers

`pvr_respond` also calls `mark_response_sent` after a successful state transition, keeping single-advisory and bulk runs in sync. Once a marker exists, neither `pvr_respond` nor `pvr_respond_batch` will re-process it.

---

## Duplicate Detection

Both `pvr_triage` and `pvr_triage_batch` use the `compare_advisories` tool to detect duplicate or near-duplicate advisories in the triage inbox.

**How it works:** Each advisory is fingerprinted using structural fields (CWE IDs, package, version range, file paths from description). Pairs with overlapping fields are flagged with a match level:

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| strong | Same package AND (same CWE or same files or same version range) |
| moderate | Same package alone, or CWE + files overlap |
| weak | Any single field overlap |

**In batch mode:** The scored queue table includes a Duplicates column showing cluster membership. Clusters of strong/moderate matches get the "Likely Duplicate -- Triage Best" action.

**In single-advisory mode:** The quality gate checks for duplicates and surfaces the info in the report, but never auto-closes. Maintainers always decide.

See [SCORING.md](SCORING.md) Section 5 for full details.

---

## Container Validation (optional)

When `PVR_CONTAINER_VALIDATION=true`, `pvr_triage` performs automated validation in an isolated Docker container running the SAST image (`seclab-shell-sast:latest`).

### What it does

1. **Clone + checkout** — clones the repo and checks out the affected version.
2. **SAST scan** — runs semgrep on reported file paths.
3. **Reachability analysis** — traces the call graph to determine if the reported function is reachable from public entry points (pyan3 for Python, cscope for C/C++, grep-based for others).
4. **PoC reproduction** — attempts best-effort reproduction of provided PoC steps (safe commands only; no network access or destructive operations).
5. **Patch analysis** — diffs the affected version against HEAD to verify whether a fix exists and addresses the reported vulnerability.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Build the SAST container image
./scripts/build_container_images.sh

# Enable container validation
export PVR_CONTAINER_VALIDATION=true
```

### Effect on triage

- Unreachable functions → severity downgrade in the assessment
- Semgrep findings → corroborate or contradict reporter claims
- Successful PoC reproduction → strongest confirmation evidence
- Results appear in the **Validation Results** section of the triage report

See [SCORING.md](SCORING.md) Section 6 for full details.

## Typical workflow

```
1. Run pvr_triage_batch to see what's in your inbox and prioritise.

2. For each advisory you want to analyse:
   Run pvr_triage.

3. Review the saved report in REPORT_DIR:
   - Check the Verdict and Code Verification sections.
   - Edit the response draft (_response_triage.md) if needed.

4a. Apply a state transition with pvr_respond:
    - action=accept    → move to draft (triage → draft)
    - action=reject    → close (triage → closed)
    Then post the response draft manually via the advisory URL.

4b. Or apply state transitions to all pending advisories at once with pvr_respond_batch:
    Scans REPORT_DIR for pending entries (no _response_sent.md marker)
    and applies the chosen action to all of them in one session.
    Then post each response draft manually via the advisory URL.
```

### Example session

```bash
# Step 1: score the inbox
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_triage_batch \
  -g repo=acme/widget

# Step 2: triage the highest-priority advisory
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_triage \
  -g repo=acme/widget \
  -g ghsa=GHSA-1234-5678-abcd

# Step 3: review the output
cat reports/GHSA-1234-5678-abcd_triage.md
cat reports/GHSA-1234-5678-abcd_response_triage.md

# Step 4a: accept (triage → draft) — vulnerability confirmed
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_respond \
  -g repo=acme/widget \
  -g ghsa=GHSA-1234-5678-abcd \
  -g action=accept

# Step 4b: or reject (triage → closed) — invalid or low-quality report
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_respond \
  -g repo=acme/widget \
  -g ghsa=GHSA-1234-5678-abcd \
  -g action=reject

# Step 4c: or apply state transitions to all pending advisories at once
python -m seclab_taskflow_agent \
  -t seclab_taskflows.taskflows.pvr_triage.pvr_respond_batch \
  -g repo=acme/widget \
  -g action=reject

# Step 5: post each response draft manually via the advisory URL
# See taskflows/pvr_triage/MANUAL_RESPONSE.md for instructions
```

## Reporter reputation

Every completed `pvr_triage` run records the verdict and quality rating against the reporter's GitHub login in a local SQLite database (`REPORTER_DB_DIR/reporter_reputation.db`).

The quality gate in Task 3 of `pvr_triage` calls `get_reporter_score` automatically before any code analysis. The score summary appears in the report under **Reporter Reputation**.

**Reputation thresholds:**

| Condition | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| confirmed_pct ≥ 60% and Low-quality share ≤ 20% | high trust |
| confirmed_pct ≤ 20% or Low-quality share ≥ 50% | treat with skepticism |
| Otherwise | normal |

Reputation directly gates the fast-close decision. See [SCORING.md](SCORING.md) Section 3 for the full three-path decision table and reputation × fast-close matrix.

---

## Models

The taskflows use `seclab_taskflows.configs.model_config_pvr_triage`, which defines two model roles:

| Role | Used for | Default model |
|---|---|---|
| `triage` | Code verification and report generation | `claude-opus-4.6-1m` |
| `extraction` | Fetch/parse, quality gate, save tasks | `gpt-5-mini` |

Override the model config by setting `AI_API_ENDPOINT` and `AI_API_TOKEN` to point at a compatible provider.

---

## Output files

All files are written to `REPORT_DIR` (default: `./reports`).

| File | Written by | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `<GHSA-ID>_triage.md` | `pvr_triage` task 6 | Full triage analysis report |
| `<GHSA-ID>_response_triage.md` | `pvr_triage` task 8 | Plain-text response draft for the reporter |
| `<GHSA-ID>_response_sent.md` | `pvr_respond` / `pvr_respond_batch` | Marker: state transition applied (contains ISO timestamp); post draft manually |
| `batch_queue_<repo>_<date>.md` | `pvr_triage_batch` task 3 | Ranked inbox table with Age column |
